In the vue.js form file(form.php), we have created a Vue component with a form that includes input fields for all the required contact information fields. We have also included a submit button that will trigger the submitForm method when clicked.
In the submitForm method, we create a data object with all the form field values and then make a POST request to the Laravel REST API endpoint for saving contacts. We use the Axios library to make the AJAX call and handle the response and errors accordingly.
For Saving contacts we have created the Laravel REST API endpoints
Creating the code for the ContactController in Laravel for saving contacts:(contactcontroller.php).
In the contactcontroller.php code, we have defined a store method in the ContactController that will handle the POST request for saving contact information. We use Laravel's validation feature to validate the request data and create a new Contact model using the validated data. After that, we send an email notification to the user using the ContactNotification Mailable. Finally, we return a JSON response with a success message and the saved contact information.
